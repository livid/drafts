# Planet Feature Update 9

In this update, blogging with Planet is now a more feature-complete experience! We are so excited to bring you Tags and Archive, as well as enhancements for pinning.

## Tags

You can now add tags to posts either through Article Settings or via a new tagging icon in Writer.

Each tag will then generate its own page, so all posts with that tag can be viewed from one page.

## Archive

A new Archive page has been added. It contains links to all the posts on the site.

We have updated the three built-in templates to accommodate the new Tags and Archive features.

## Change App Icon

A new Icon Gallery has been added for you to choose a new icon for the Planet app.

If you own Pinnable NFT Series A, then you can unlock two special icons that have animations in the Dock upon startup.

## Select Hero Image

When you have multiple images attached to a post, you can now select one of them as the hero image. The hero image will be displayed when you share the post link on social sites like Twitter or Discord.

## Enhancements for Pinnable

Multiple enhancements have been implemented for the Pinnable integration. Now, when you enable Pinnable for your Planet sites, you will experience more instantaneous feedback from the service.
