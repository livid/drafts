# sol.build

sol.build is a gateway for websites running on SOL+IPFS.

If you set an IPNS or IPFS record in your Solana name, you can access the IPNS/IPFS website by appending .build to your .sol name. Here are a few examples:

- [planetable.sol.build](https://planetable.sol.build/)
- [ohlife.sol](https://ohlife.sol.build/)

There are a couple of ways to build an IPFS website. The easiest is by using the Planet app. Planet is a free and open-source static site generator. You can use it to build a website, choose from multiple themes, or create your own. It also works with other static site build systems. Planet publishes your website as an IPNS record that can be linked to your Solana name. The site is hosted on the local IPFS node included in the app, so no remote server or service is required.
